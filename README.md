# AI Health Assistant (SwasthMitra)

This repository contains a Flutter medical assistant app with AI-assisted symptom analysis and a nearby-doctors feature (geolocation + mock availability).

What I added/changed
- AI symptom analysis integration (existing `AIService`)
- Nearby doctors feature using `DoctorService` (geolocation + mock API fallback)
- UI page `NearbyDoctorsPage` at `lib/pages/nearby_doctors.dart`
- `DoctorModel` extended with availability fields

Run locally
1. Install dependencies:
```bash
flutter pub get
```
2. Run the app:
```bash
flutter run
```

Honesty note
This project includes code written by you and may have been implemented with guidance. Be transparent about any assistance when submitting to coursework.

If you want, I can suggest how to split your work into logical commits and write a short author statement to include in the repository.
